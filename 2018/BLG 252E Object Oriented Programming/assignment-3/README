I've seperated all header and cpp files. A Makefile is included. In order to compile everything enter the command "make". An executable named "main" should be appear after that. You can then run "./main" normally. Or if you have any problem with this one, you can change the name of "main2.cpp" to "main.cpp" and everything should be OK! One last thing, my code works with only c++11 version.
